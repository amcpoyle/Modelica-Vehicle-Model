# Modelica-Vehicle-Model
Defining a vehicle model in Modelica for efficient, reusable modeling and simulation.
The goal of this project is to learn about Modelica best practices and create a vehicle model for an FSAE car. By utilizing OpenModelica for a comprehensive vehicle model, development changes are easy to make and all aspects of the vehicle are clearly organized. This will reduce time and complexity for developing models in the future by creating reproducable and easily adaptable code blocks that represent models for various aspects of the car.
